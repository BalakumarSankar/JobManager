# Immediate TODO List - Job Dispatcher

## üéØ **Next Immediate Tasks**

### 1. Job Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add retry configuration to `application.properties`
- [ ] Create `RetryConfig` class with exponential backoff settings
- [ ] Update `ScheduledJob` entity to track retry attempts
- [ ] Implement `JobRetryService` for retry logic
- [ ] Add retry endpoints to `JobController`
- [ ] Update `JobDispatcherService` to handle retries
- [ ] Add retry statistics to monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Jobs can be configured with max retry attempts
- Exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Retry only on specific exception types
- Retry statistics visible in monitoring

### 2. Job Priority System
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `JobPriority` enum (CRITICAL, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW, BACKGROUND)
- [ ] Add priority field to `OneTimeJobRequest` and `RepetitiveJobRequest`
- [ ] Update `ScheduledJob` entity with priority field
- [ ] Implement priority-based thread pool queues
- [ ] Update `JobDispatcherService` to respect priority
- [ ] Add priority-based rate limiting
- [ ] Update monitoring to show priority statistics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Jobs can be submitted with priority levels
- Higher priority jobs execute before lower priority
- Priority affects rate limiting (higher priority = higher limits)
- Priority visible in job monitoring

### 3. Job Timeout Handling
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Low | **Impact**: High

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add timeout configuration to job requests
- [ ] Implement `CompletableFuture` with timeout in `JobDispatcherService`
- [ ] Add timeout field to `ScheduledJob` entity
- [ ] Handle timeout exceptions gracefully
- [ ] Update job status to TIMEOUT
- [ ] Add timeout statistics to monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Jobs can specify execution timeout
- Jobs are cancelled if they exceed timeout
- Timeout events are logged and tracked
- Timeout statistics available in monitoring

### 4. Enhanced Security - API Key Authentication
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `ApiKey` entity and repository
- [ ] Implement `ApiKeyAuthenticationFilter`
- [ ] Add API key management endpoints
- [ ] Update `JobController` with API key validation
- [ ] Add API key to rate limiting logic
- [ ] Create API key generation and rotation logic
- [ ] Add API key usage statistics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- External apps must provide valid API key
- API keys can be generated and revoked
- API key usage is tracked and rate limited
- API keys have expiration dates

## üîÑ **In Progress Tasks**

### Recently Completed
